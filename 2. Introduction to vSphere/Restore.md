Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a client-server protocol used to synchronize a computerâ€™s clock to a time reference. NTP is important:

* For accurate performance graphs
* For accurate time stamps in log messages
* So that virtual machines have a source to synchronize with 

An ESXi host can be configured as an NTP client. It can synchronize time with an NTP server on the Internet or your corporate NTP Server
