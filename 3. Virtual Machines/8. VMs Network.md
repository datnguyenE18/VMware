- **Network Address Translation (NAT) Network:**
  - Network address translation is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. </br>

  - VMs must be able to reach the internet/other systems in the network. The NAT device is a DNS proxy. It forwards DNS requests from the virtual machines to a DNS server that the host knows. Responses return to the NAT device, which then forwards them to the virtual machines.

- **Bridge Network**
  - A network bridge is a computer networking device that creates a single, aggregate network from multiple communication networks or network segments. This function is called network bridging. Bridging is distinct from routing. </br>

  - Bridged networking connects a virtual machine to a network by using the network adapter on the host system. If the host system is on a network, bridged networking is often the easiest way to give the virtual machine access to that network. </br>

  - VMs must be visible in the external network </br>

- **Overview:**
  - With bridged networking, the VM is accessible from the network. "NAT" on the other hand shares the hosts network connection by assigning the VMs an IP address from a private network, and translates network requests from the guest.
