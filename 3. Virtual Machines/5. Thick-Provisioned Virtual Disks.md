Thick provisioning uses all the defined disk space at the creation of the virtual disk. VM disks consume all the capacity, as defined at creation, regardless of the amount of data in the guest operating system file system.

Thick-provisioned disk types are eager zeroed or lazy zeroed:
* **In an eager-zeroed thick-provisioned disk:** space required for the virtual disk is allocated during creationg. Data remaining on the physical device is zeroed out when the disk is created. If you seleck this check box, this virtual machine can thake advantage of vmware fault tolerance.
	
* **In a lazy-zeroed thick-provisioned disk:** space required for the virtual disk is allowcated during creation. Data remaining on the physical device is not erased during creation, but is zeroed out on demand at a later time on first write from the virtual machine
