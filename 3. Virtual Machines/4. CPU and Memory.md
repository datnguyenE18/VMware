You can add, change, or configure CPU and memory resources to improve VM performance. The maximum number of virtual CPUs (vCPUs) that you can assign to a VM depends on the following factors:
* The number of logical CPUs on the host
* The type of installed guest operating system

AVM running on an ESXi 7.x host can have up to 256 vCPUs. 

The maximum memory size of a VM depends on the VMâ€™s compatibility setting. 

The maximum memory size of a VM with ESXi 7.0 compatibility running on ESXi 7.0 is 6 TB.
