With thin provisioning, VMs use storage space as needed:
* Virtual disks consume only the capacity needed to hold the current files.
* AVM sees the full allocated disk size at all times.

Run the unmap command to reclaim unused space from the array. 

Reporting and alerts help manage allocations and capacity. 

You can mix thick and thin formats. More efficient use of storage, for example: 

* Provisioned space for virtual disks: 140 GB 
* Available datastore capacity: 100 GB 
* Used datastore capacity: 80 GB
